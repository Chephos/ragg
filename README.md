# ragg
A simple reimplementation of RAG.
A doculing [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869) is loaded, chunked, embedded, and used as a datastore.
You can ask the chatbot questions about the report.
It's quite slow too. Looking forward to optimizing soon.

## How to run
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the project folder
- Run python services.py.
- A sample query to ask the chatbot: "Explain doculing to me like I'm 5."

I tried adding a web interface using FastAPI, but I encountered some problems. Looking forward to working on that too.
